# Notes

What the code does not say for itself. The reasoning lives here so PR bodies
can stay to what changed.

## Publishing

- **`repository.url` has to match the repo's canonical name, exactly.**
  `publishConfig.provenance` makes npm mint a Sigstore attestation from the
  Actions OIDC token, then refuse the upload unless `repository.url` matches
  the repo name in it. **A GitHub rename redirect does not count.** The
  mismatch arrived in `830b2bc` (URL changed from `yummaui` to `ui`) and cost
  nothing for three releases because the repo was called `ui` then; renaming
  it turned the same line into a hard `422` and failed v0.3.0 twice. The
  failure reads as a build failure and is not one: types, tests, build and
  pack all pass, and it dies on the last step. `publish.yml` checks the two
  against each other before it installs anything.
- A publish run from a laptop cannot work no matter how the credentials are
  set up: `provenance: true` needs the `id-token: write` OIDC token, which
  only a workflow run has.
