## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- `init` and `add` now say when Yumma CSS is not set up in the project, naming
  what is missing: `yummacss`, the plugin for the detected framework
  (`@yummacss/postcss` for Next.js, `@yummacss/vite` otherwise), and
  `yumma.config.mjs`.

### Changed

- `--help` now names the package manager the project uses, instead of always
  saying `npx`. Every other hint the CLI prints already did.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-30

### Changed

- `prune` no longer skips `dist`, `.next` and similar directories by name.
  Guessing which folders hold build output made it delete more readily, and a
  stale build naming a component is a reason to keep it.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- add `yummaui prune`, which lists component files nothing in the project
  reaches. Pass `--write` to delete them.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- add `yummaui add --all` command, use the `--all` flag to install all components at once.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Initial release.
